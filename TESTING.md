| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --- |
| On clicking the 'create session'/'update session'/'delete session' buttons in quick succession, <br>multiple sessions were logged, updated and tried to be deleted. | Put block on buttons once they've been clicked. |     |
| Delete Success Message wasn't displaying because there was no form_valid to attach to.                                                                              | Created success message mixin.                  |     |
| Limit on date selection not working - the calander looked like future <br>dates were being blocked but they could be selected manually.                             | Added validate date method to models.py.        |     |
