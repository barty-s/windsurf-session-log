# Windsurfer - Windsurfing Training Log App

## The Purpose of the Project

Most wearable tech devices have features to record the sporting activities you do - running, cycling, yoga etc. However, there is no feature to record windsurfing training sessions. This app can be used by windsurfers to log their training sessions which will allow them to track their progress on the water.
