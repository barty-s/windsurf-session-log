# Windsurfer - Windsurfing Training Log App

## The Purpose of the Project

Most wearable tech devices have features to record various sporting activities - running, cycling, yoga etc. However, there is no feature to record windsurfing training sessions. This app can be used by windsurfers to log their training sessions which will allow them to track their progress on the water.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to create a profile and log in and out.
As a user, I want to be able to create, read, update and delete training sessions from my log.

As admin, I want to be able to delete users or sessions from the database using the superuser access, if required.

## Features

Landing page - sign up button
Sign up page - sign up form
My Sessions page - list of sessions logged by the user
Log a Session page - session log form
Session detail page - user can access the details of a selected session
Edit Session page - edit session form
Delete Session page - user can to erase a selected session from their log
Sign out page - sign out button

## Future Features
